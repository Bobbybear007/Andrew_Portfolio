    <h2>The Moon as Seen from New Zealand</h2>
    <p>
      The "Moonlight" project was born out of my fascination with the night sky and the unique perspective we have here in New Zealand. In this series, I used the moon as a subject to test the limits of my camera’s capabilities and my own editing techniques using Lightroom. Each photograph represents a different phase of the moon, as seen from various angles, under different atmospheric conditions, and at different times of the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout this project, I experimented with exposure, shutter speed, and ISO settings to capture subtle details of the moon’s surface, including its craters, shadows, and glow. The changing positions of the moon and the interplay between light and darkness allowed me to explore how light interacts with celestial bodies. These images capture the serenity and mystique of the moon while also showcasing the technical capabilities of modern photography equipment.
    </p>

      In post-production, I focused on enhancing the natural textures and contrasts that emerged in the raw images. By adjusting sharpness and vibrance, I was able to bring out the moon’s fine details, offering a more intimate look at a subject that is often viewed from afar. The goal was to not only document the beauty of the moon but also evoke a sense of wonder and connection with the universe.
