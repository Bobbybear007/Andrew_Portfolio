      <h2>My Game Jam journey</h2> 
      <p>My journey with Game Jams only began in 2024, but in this short time, I’ve gained a wealth of knowledge and experience. Each event has pushed me to grow creatively and technically, allowing me to explore new ideas and refine my skills under tight deadlines. What I find most rewarding is working in a collaborative environment where everyone’s unique contributions are essential to the team’s success.  </p>
      <h3>Key Game Jams</h3>

<!-- Project 1 -->
<div class="mod-project">
  <h4>The Beginners Jam Summer 2024</h4>
  <h5>The Special Time Fixing Unit</h5>
  <p>
    The Special Time Fixing Unit is a sci-fi puzzle-platformer where players take on the role of a trainee in a future where time travel is possible—but with high stakes. The slightest error in time manipulation could result in catastrophic consequences, endangering both the world and the fabric of space-time. As a recruit in the Special Time Fixing Unit, your goal is to prevent these disasters by mastering time travel and working with your past selves to solve complex puzzles and avoid paradoxes.
    The game was created for the Beginner’s Jam Summer 2024, aligning with the theme “Outside the Boundaries.” Time travel is a key mechanic that challenges players to step beyond the typical boundaries of time to progress. With retro-styled 2D art and a thoughtful combination of puzzle-solving and platforming, the game provides a rewarding experience for those who enjoy mind-bending challenges
